# Food Bank Application


## What Does It Do?
-----

### `Problem`
Manually filling out food bank applications, creating food bank attendance lists, and tallying up the number of people that have attended a food bank, is both tedious and time consuming.  

### `Solution`
With this food application the user can:

    -Fill out a food bank application.
    -Instantly find out if the applicant qualifies.
    -Create, update and delete food bank lists, and applicants.
    -Have access to a dynamic attendance sheet, that you can add and remove from on the day of the event.
    -Have access to all of the statistics needed for the food bank organization.
 

## Features
-----
### `Login Page`
For demo purposes the username is "Demo" and the password is "demo123".

### `Dashboard Page`
The dashboard page supplies the user with all of the statistics from the most recently created foodbank attendance list.

### `New Applicant Page`
Supplies a very simple looking form for the user to fill out.  Upon completing the form the user is notified if the applicant qualifies or not.

### `Search Page`
Provides the user the ability to look up an applicant's information and the ability to print the official foodbank form, with the data all pre-filled.

### `Foodbank List Dashboard`
Gives the user three different options.


    -Create Foodbank List
    -Search Foodbank Lists
    -Current Foodbank List

### `Create Foodbank List Page`
Gives the user the ability to create a new list and add applicants to the list.  This page automatically saves, so there is no need to worry about saving.

### `Search Foodbank Lists Page`
The user is provided the chance to search past lists and delete them if they so desire.

### `Current Foodbank List Page`
This is a dynamic attendance sheet that is to be used on the day of the foodbank, or if you ever need to add applicants to the current list.


## Getting Started
----
### `Node`
You will need to have node.js installed on your local system.  You can do this by following the directions listed [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### `Dependencies` 
Once Node is installed.  In the project directory , you will need to install all of the package.json dependencies, this can be done by running. 

    npm install

### `Change Directory`
You will need to enter into the correct directory in your terminal.

    cd my-app

### `Development Mode` 
The development mode will ron on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  The development mode can be started by running the command.  (Keep in mind, none of the app will run completely in development mode, as most of it relies on being connected to the server).

    npm run start



###

###
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
