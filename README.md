# Food Bank Application

# What Does It Do?

### `Problem`
Manually filling out food bank applications, creating food bank attendance lists, and tallying up the number of people that have attended a food bank, is both tedious and time consuming.  

<br/>

### `Solution`
With this food application the user can:

- Fill out a food bank application.
- Instantly find out if the applicant qualifies.
- Create, update and delete food bank lists, and applicants.
- Have access to a dynamic attendance sheet, that you can add and remove from on the day of the event.
- Have access to all of the statistics needed for the food bank organization.

#  Summary
This application was created largely for my wife.  She is in charge of running the logistics of the food bank at our church, and I thought it was crazy that she was still doing everything with pen and paper.  I built this app to streamline the foodbank application process, and simplify this aspect of her life.  I hope that others can benefit from it as well.

If you would like to have any fetures added or if you would like to make any, just shoot me a message or a pull request.  Thanks for checking out my food bank app.
